# AI-Flappy-Bird

An AI simuklated game of flappy bird made in Python using Pygame. The game simulates multiple birds attempting to progress through the game, takes the best bird of a particular generation and has its children in the next generation. The application works towards a perfect generation in which a bird can infinitely progress through a level without error.
